Functions for EEGLAB:

addEEGEvents.m was written in order to select only stimulus-locked events in an EEG experiment followed by a correct response. The function is only able to catch these events if the stimulus-locked event is followed by triggers coding the correctness of the response to the stimulus (i.e. no other EEG events in between).
